# News Site

This is my news site which gives you news from a cat shelter with a playful tone of voice. 

## The problem

I decided to approach it with playfulness since I have worked some with HTML and CSS before. I wanted to mix it up so I’ve used grid for the main section of my website, to place the main content. But I’ve used flexbox in my footer and the top div with the ”big news” just to mix it up some and to practice placing with different techniques. 

If I had more time I would have made it with more pages and some Javascript, especially for the main menu and an accordion and form.
